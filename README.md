curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VTFoundation/ssh-installer/tree/main/install_ssh.sh | sudo bash

This script now ensures that both curl and openssh-server are installed, making it a more comprehensive setup script. Remember to follow the same steps as before to make this script executable and to run it. Here's a quick recap:

Save the Script: Paste this updated script into a new file named install_ssh.sh.

Make it Executable:
chmod +x install_ssh.sh

Run the Script:

sudo ./install_ssh.sh
